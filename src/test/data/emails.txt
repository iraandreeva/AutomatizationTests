Automated Tests Implementation Practice #1: Negative Account Registration
Implement a test to verify that correct errors are shown on the registration page when trying to register an account with invalid values or\and empty required fields.

Create a separate XML suite for negative tests.

Create a separate XML suite for page element tests.



Automated Tests Implementation Practice #3: Placing an Order
Implement a test to place an order for your account. As a result order should be displayed in the list of orders in account details. It is not required to implement a test to verify the order details after that.

Create a separate XML suite for this test.
